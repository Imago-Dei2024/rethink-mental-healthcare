            At ReThink Mental Health, we combine the best of conventional psychiatry with evidence-based holistic therapies 
            to address your mental well-being from every angleâ€”mind, body, and spirit.

          <p className="integrative-psych-intro-paragraph">
            Integrative psychiatry is about understanding you as a whole person, not just addressing your symptoms. 
            From medication management and talk therapy to natural supplements and lifestyle adjustments, 
            each component is tailored to your unique needs.
          </p>
          
          <p className="integrative-psych-intro-paragraph">
            Our approach recognizes that mental health is influenced by many factors including genetics, nutrition, 
            physical health, life experiences, environment, and spirituality. By addressing all of these areas, 
            we create comprehensive treatment plans that promote lasting wellness.
